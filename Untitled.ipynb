    "\n",
    "We initially cleaned the data. We did this with the use of the data dictionary.\n",
    "We used the data dictionary to understand what values should be in each column. This was particularly relevant in the columns that were made up of qualitative data. Such as sex, age, and education. The cleaning of the data has been interesting for a couple of reasons... Firstly, marital status should have only contained the numbers 1 or 2. Thus, married or not married. We were getting the number 0 fairly often. We decided to change all of the 0's to the number 3 and they would fall under the catagory of \"others\". The second interesting column that needed cleaning was payment status. Some people had negative numbers. Meaning they had paid their bills off early. We decided to change all negative numbers to 0 to indicate that they had simply paid on time. \n",

    "### Modeling ###\n",
    "\n",
    "For our modeling we have decided there are a number of potential options that we will look at. There are three different models that we are going to look at. The two that we are going to concentrate on are the Random Forest and the xgboost. We will run them for ten random train test splits. We will then average the performance of ten of these trials to establish which one performs best. \n",
